# Flask Webapp
This repository contains a Flask web application that utilizes various libraries and tools for creating and managing a web application with a database. The application includes features such as user login, database migrations, form handling, and password hashing.

# Goal
This project is meant for me to develope S/W engineering skills. I really like python and want to start learning Flask and Django first. Hence why this project. 

# Project Objective
I have a couple of ideas of what this webapp's purpose will be, will updated later.
1.	Perhaps an app called "mylist" people can make lists of things they love. like fav movie, video games, dishes, even random ones like favorite philosophers.
